NAME
    App::Grok - Does most of grok's heavy lifting

DESCRIPTION
    This class provides the main functionality needed by grok. It has some
    methods you can use if you need to hook into grok.

METHODS
  "new"
    This is the constructor. It takes no arguments.

  "run"
    If you call this method, it will look at the command line arguments in
    @ARGV and act accordingly. This is basically what the "grok" program
    does. Takes no arguments.

  "target_index"
    Takes no arguments. Returns a list of all the targets known to "grok".

  "detect_source"
    Takes a filename as an argument. Returns the name of the appropriate
    "App::Grok::*" class to parse it. Returns nothing if the file doesn't
    contain any Pod.

  "locate_target"
    Takes a target name as an argument. Returns the path to the target, or
    nothing if the target is not recognized.

  "render_target"
    Takes two arguments, a target and the name of an output format. Returns
    a string containing the rendered documentation, or nothing if the target
    is unrecognized.

  "render_file"
    Takes two arguments, a filename and the name of an output format.
    Returns a string containing the rendered document. Note: this method is
    called by "render_target".
